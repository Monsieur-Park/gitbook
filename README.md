**The Neo4j database** is a graph database and is used to represent the data in the form of graphs. Since the data is huge and is networked,
the data relationships should also be given equal importance, which is achieved by using Graph Database.

Graphs provide a concise and intuitive abstraction for a variety of domains, where edges capture the (potentially cyclical) relations between the entities inherent in historical data. They also allow maintainers to postpone the definition of a schema, allowing the data – and its scope
– to evolve in a more flexible manner than typically possible in a relational setting, particularly for capturing incomplete knowledge.

**Neo4j** is an ideal platform on which to investigate the data collected in the Research project [Governance of the Universal Church after the Council of Trent](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/research-group/governance-of-the-universal-church-after-the-council-of-trent)

Beyond conventional searches, it allows to find connections and patterns in the relations between entities, actors and processes by using an array of graph analysis algorithms.

In summary, the decision to build and use a graph opens up a range of techniques than can be brought to bear for integrating and extracting value from diverse sources of data.

The goal of this tutorial paper is to motivate and give a comprehensive introduction to graph modell: we describe how we ingest our data and build our graph, and describes some example queries taking advantage of the graph database.
