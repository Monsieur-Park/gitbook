# What is Graph Databse?

* A Graph database (GraphDB) is a database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store information.
* GraphDB has a completely flexible structure.

* Most importantly, GraphDB saves the relationships that connect your data.
* That means, each data record or node contains direct pointers to all the nodes that it's connected to.
